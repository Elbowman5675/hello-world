# hello-world
my first repo

Creating my first branch to update the readme file and commit the changes.

I will use this account to contribute to blog posts in my community
I hope to also use Node.js to dabble in home automation, particularly for my pool and hot tub
I'm sure it will take hours to figure out how to add voice commands to Google home for something I could do in seconds via my phone or PC.
